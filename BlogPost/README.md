## Libraries <a name="libraries"></a>
Numpy, Pandas - for data analysis 
Matplotlib & Seaborn - for visualizations 
Sklearn - for gridsearch and modeling 

## Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
Exploration of FIFA player 19 dataset gave me an opportunity to merge my interest of DataScience and Soccer. 
When I saw the dataset, I wanted to ask myself several questions almost immediately and hence started the exploration to find the answer to such questions. 
This Project helped me satiate my Curiosity. 

## File <a name="files"></a>
fifa19.ipynb - This is the notebook that contains the code for the analysis/exploration of the fifa datset. 

## Results <a name="results"></a>
We asked the below questions and got the corresponding answers:
1. Is there a relationship between Market Value and Wages of Players?
-> Market Value do affect Wage of a Player to an extent.
2. What is the preferred Foot among the players and how does it affect their positioning?
-> Yes, Foot do have an impact but only little not very substantial.
3. Can we predict the Value of a player based on its attributes (like accuracy, shot power, reactions, dribbling etc)?
-> Not all Features are equally useful, also one can predict the Market value given enough data and attributes of Players.
4. Clubs with the highest median wages (Top 11)?
-> Juventas, FC Barcelona, etc (refer notebook/blogpost for more)
5. Players with largest release clause (Top 11)?
-> L. Suarez, G. Bale, etc (refer notebook/blogpost for more)
